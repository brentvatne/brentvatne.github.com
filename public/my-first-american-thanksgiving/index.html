    <section class="blog-post-body">
      <p>It's the Sunday after Thanksgiving, and today I was driving from Phoenix towards
Los Angeles on the I10 desert highway, where the sun burns hot even in late November.
The Arizona leg of the trip featured shredded tires and roadkill all along the
shoulder. There was a fifty-odd mile stretch of road along Joshua Tree National
Park where cars were hopelessly attracted to each other. We passed the
aftermath of three or four serious accidents, one including a car that too closely
resembled the teenage Toyota Corolla I was driving, except that it was upside down
and spread across two lanes of the highway. I purposefully followed an idle Ambulance
for several miles before traffic separated us.</p>

<p>... the sun disappeared, eclipsed by a mammoth RV passing me on my left.
Soon it also obscured the road beside me, as the pleasurecraft drifted over and
began pressing against my door. It was unfased as my rear-view frame crumpled
and fell off, like a discarded piece of paper, the mirror shattering and
raining down onto hot cement. I watched in disbelief as the situation unfolded.
I somehow had the good sense to not swerve away, where I would
have been met by another equally hostile, yet innocent, third party. After what
I can only guess was about five seconds of friction, the road became visible again
as the RV moved away, and I honked several times out of anger and a
desire to intiate post-accident protocol.</p>

<p>When I came to a stop, I pushed at the door and it wouldn't open - the
collision had bent some part of its hinge and rendered it unfit for
opening, which is a pretty essential part of its job. So I crawled out of the
passenger side. I was trembling. The last time I had felt like this was during
an attempted robbery in Argentina, and remembering that event allowed me to
focus and regain my composure.</p>

<p>The driver was a retired California Highway Patrol officer with a Louis CK face
but without the sense of humour. He apolized for not seeing me in his blind spot.
We exchanged contact information and he helped clip off the remainder of the
rear-view that dangled by wire, at my request. I drove to the next
exit and took a breather in a fried-chicken joint, where I absent mindedly left my
cell-phone-wallet (a single point of failure, I knew it would bite me
one day but just so damned convenient). Traffic for the rest of the drive back was
stop-and-go until the LA itself.</p>

<p>So Noelia's car is damaged, although not irreparably so, my Sunday was
spent almost entirely in a car, and I'm short a phone and a couple of plastic cards.
It could have been so much worse. This Thankiving Weekend, my first ever in America,
I am thankful that Noleia, Cynthia, and myself were fortunate enough to emerge
from that stretch of highway in good health.</p>
