description: The negative reaction I had to React was visceral, at first.

If you follow [the hype](http://news.ycombinator.com), you probably get the
impression that React has supplanted Angular as the hot-new-silver-bullet-solution
to all of your front-end-development problems. JSX, props, state, Flux with
Stores, Dispatchers, Actions, componentDid/WillMount and other lifecycle
events, Jest - just a week ago all of these seemed unnecessary (as I'm sure
directives, transclusion and scope did at one time). The negative reaction I
had to these words was visceral. Another set of concepts to learn - wasn't
Angular good enough?!

I doubt I'm the only one that has felt this sort of reaction when a new tool
challenges one you've invested so much time in and enjoy using on a daily
basis.

My hesitation to give React serious consideration seems to have been borne out
of a combination of stubbornness, cynicism, unwillingness to move away from the
comparatively more established and understood eco-system built around Angular,
and well, because I actually haven't felt like I have had any issues with
Angular since I got over the initial learning curve about 10 months ago. I
I was able to easily avoid performance issues through pagination of lists and
one-way binding. In the event that something doesn't work quite as expected, I
find a quick work-around and continue on. I've built up a library of snippets that
speed up my workflow. I don't find the directive API to be confusing as many do.

So when did I become the kind of developer that avoids a tool for irrational,
emotional reasons? When did I stop trying to use the best tools for the job and
instead just use what I know?

As developers we all acknowledge that keeping up-to-date with new software
tools and techniques is part of the job, but as humans we let our emotions and
hard-wired resistance to change get in the way. Looking back on learning
Angular, I remember feeling the same way as I felt about React, at first - I
wanted to just stick with Backbone.

I believe that a similar phenomenon applies to learning. We defend and identify with
the knowledge we have and the tools that we use, and mistake the lack of problems
we run into while applying them as proof of their worth. But try considering these
questions:

- How easy is it for someone new to pick it up and get going?
- Have you been unconsciously avoiding certain types of solutions because
  you're limited by the techniques that you have available to you?
- Are there new problems that you haven't yet faced that will be better handled by
  this tool?
- Is there not a better way?
- If there is, don't you want to know what it is?

I'm not suggesting that you throw away everything you know each time something new
comes out - at the rate that the software world changes, you would never get anything
done. But there is so much to be learned by just keeping an open mind and giving
everything an honest look.

Tool developers certainly don't make this easy for you - most seem perfectly
happy to market their solution as superior to others in every way. For the sake
of example, not to pick on anyone in particular - why doesn't
[angularjs.org](angularjs.org) have a pros/cons table, comparing it with React,
Ember, Backbone and whatever else, as well as a list of good use cases, and refer you
to another framework when your problem does not apply? Surely there would be
no-one better to write this than the framework authors themselves.

So if you do front-end development and haven't tried out React yet, go ahead
and check out the [awesome-react](https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react)
and get familiar with it ([egghead.io](egghead.io) React videos are great too).
If you don't, then take some time to look into whatever new technology you've
either been wanting to learn or have been avoiding for a reason similar to what I
felt with React.
