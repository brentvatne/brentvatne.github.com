title: Learning at Mendicant University
description: About my experiences at the school during January, 2012.
---

I spent the last three weeks studying at Mendicant University, formerly known as Ruby Mendicant University. I did not physically attend any campus, because no such facility exists. Instead, I communicated through a private IRC channel, a mailing list, an internal school management system, and Github with a group of passionate and charitable programmers who have made it their mission to help others improve at programming - specifically in Ruby. I took the "Core Skills" course, an entry point into the community that requires a demonstration of intermediate proficiency with Ruby
in order to be accepted.

Mendicant University does not limit itself as a school that teaches the trade of programming; it has broader goals including building a community of like-minded good citizens (who happen to love programming) dedicated to self improvement, advocating contributions to open source, and encouraging programmers to apply their skills to solve real problems, including those of charitable organizations that can benefit from technology. The founders have ingrained their strong opinions about software development into the course, in particular the relentless focus on delivering functional, high quality software.

The three weeks challenged me to step up my time management skills in order to deliver four functional assignments. Three of these assignments must meet defined high-quality requirements, as established by [Gregory Brown](http://community.mendicantuniversity.org/people/sandal). One of the quality satisfying assignments must be a non-trivial patch that is accepted to an open source project. Another of the assignments is a personal project; at the beginning
of the course you propose an idea and set of features for anything you want to build. The remaining two assignments are chosen from a pool of three topic areas, each of which addresses a particular problem domain. For example, one of the assignments was to build a multi-user application that does something interesting by reading and responding to e-mails; one student built an e-mail based expense tracker, another implemented an e-mail based wiki.

What really differentiates this course from many of the courses I have taken at [Simon Fraser University](http://www.sfu.ca/) is the degree of intrinsic motivation of each student and staff member. Although I felt extrinsically motivated by the desire to pass the course and have my name added to the list of alumni, that feeling was subordinate to the desire to really learn as much as I could. I saw the same motivation in other students. Most students submitted at least one detailed code review to a fellow student, giving up free time they could have been using to complete their own assignments. Staff members are all volunteers who give up a huge amount of their free time after work and on weekends to provide code reviews, help you through thorny issues, or just chat and provide moral support to get you through that next checkpoint. This experience contrasts sharply with the relentless focus on grade points that I have observed in all of my traditional educational experiences.

The course is also free, another strong contrast to the exaggeratedly overpriced, debt-inducing tuition of most universities.

I could write a lot more about the specifics of the school, but I'd rather not turn this into a long technical description of each and every detail. Instead, if you want more information, check out [mendicantuniversity.org](http://mendicantuniversity.org/) and join us in the public channel #mendicant on irc.freenode.net. If you are a practicing rubyist, I also strongly suggest you check out Greg's [Practicing Ruby](http://practicingruby.com/) newsletter. [How to attack sticky problems](http://practicingruby.com/articles/shared/iumrvfluosyi) is one of my favorite articles. The school survives based on the income brought in through Practicing Ruby subscriptions and personal donations.

So am I an expert programmer now? Resoundingly no. Did I learn a lot? Sure did.
