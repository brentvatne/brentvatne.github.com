title: Finally at Inbox Zero
description: And how you can get and stay there with Gmail
---

I've had a cluttered Inbox for as long as I can remember. I'll
occasionally forget to follow up on something or not notice an
email at all amidst the mess. If I had known it could be so easy to get
everything under control, I would have done this ages ago, but I never
took the time to look into some basic features of Gmail until recently!
I had thought that the only way to do it was to, well, delete
everything.

Using Gmail it is incredibly easy to clear out your inbox without losing
your previous emails. Search for `label:inbox`, select everything on the page,
then click "Select all conversations that match this search" and click Archive.
This will move all of your email out of your Inbox and into the All Mail tab,
where they will forever remain. It's that easy!

I would recommend, while you're there, to spend a bit of time clearing
out the obviously unneeded messages - for example, I had hundreds of
Trello notifications and a lot of exception notification from web apps
that I work on, and I just searched and did the "Select all conversations that
match this search" to delete them.

### How I plan to keep it empty

E-mail is pretty good for communication, but awful as a task manager and
general repository of knowledge. So now when I receive an email, I now
try to decide immediately where a better place for the information would
be (a todo list, my calendar, Workflowy notes) and put it there. If it's
something important and I'm not sure where to put it, or if I need to
reply to it, then I star and archive it, so I can easily find it but
it's outside of my Inbox.

I also use unroll.me to roll up unimportant but potentially interesting
emails into one daily message, so I have less to process throughout the
day and far less to delete.
